## Introduction

This project is a simulation of an iPod, built using React.js. The application allows users to interact with a menu system similar to that of a traditional iPod, navigating through options such as Settings, Games, Music, and Cover Flow. Users can navigate the menu using a circular wheel, similar to the click wheel on classic iPods, and can access submenus and features within each main menu option.

## Features

- **Circular Menu Navigation:** Navigate through the iPod's menu using a circular wheel interface.
- **Main Menu Options:** Options available include Settings, Games, Music, and Cover Flow.
- **Submenus:** Music contains submenus such as All Songs, Artists, etc.
- **Center Button Interaction:** Select an option by clicking the center button.
- **Menu Button:** Return to the main menu from any submenu or option.
- **Dynamic Content Display:** Selected options load relevant content on the screen.
- **Active State Highlighting:** The currently selected option is visually highlighted.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/palsashh/ipod.git
   cd ipod-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Navigating the Menu:**
